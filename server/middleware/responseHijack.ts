/**
 * Stupid problems sometimes require stupid solutions.
 * Unfortunately `express-graphql` has hardcoded 4xx/5xx http status codes in certain error scenarios.
 * In addition they also finalize the response, so no other middleware shall prevail in their wake.
 *
 * It's best practice to always return 200 in GraphQL APIs and specify the error in the response,
 * as otherwise clients might choke on the response or unnecessarily retry stuff.
 * Also monitoring is improved by only throwing 5xx responses on unexpected server errors.
 *
 * This middleware will hijack the `res.send` method which gives us one last chance to modify
 * the response and normalize the response status codes.
 *
 * The only alternative to this would be to either fork or ditch `express-graphql`. ;-)
